This project focuses on forecasting time series data using three different approaches: ARIMA models, Unobserved Components Models (UCM), and Machine Learning models. The dataset includes 3009 records, ranging from January 4, 2007, to March 31, 2015, containing information on the average number of days required to close requests. The objective is to predict daily values for the period between April 1, 2015, and November 7, 2015, and evaluate the models' performance using the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) metric.
